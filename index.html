            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>The year is 1850. It's almost night. Today will be the first red moon since you moved to this town, but the sun has not fully set yet. You can see a few last drops of light on the horizon in the distance. You left from your work at the rice
                field later than anyone else, thinking you will get a raise if you keep working overtime. But what you're seeing now surprises you. Not only is the owner of your favorite ramen stall not waiting for you, it seems like the whole town is
                empty. You can't find a single soul. Where is everyone? What will you do now? It is your decision to make, so choose wisely.</p>
            <p>The concept of our image is the empty street of an old japanese village at dawn.<br> When reading the rules for the rendering competition, we very quickly agreed on creating an outdoor scene in an eastern setting. Initially, we were inspired
                by nighttime photographs of side streets in modern japanese cities, with small, highly detailed buildings and neon lights. However, finding free 3D assets for our setting proved to be very difficult, so we transformed our scene into a
                less modern setting, while still keeping our core concept.</p>

            <h2>Scene</h2>
            We composed our scene in Blender by mainly using freely available 3D models and modifying them to our needs. Additionally, we added some own models such as the crates, the ground and the grass. We planned the scene construction beforehand by drawing and
            conceptualizing our rough ideas. We wanted to create a long road with a view of the houses at the sides. With a small alley on one side of the road. We also wanted to focus the viewer on one central piece in the scene, which became the ramen
            stall. We placed the temple at the end of the road and used smaller objects to decorate the scene wherever we saw fit. Then, we used freely available textures to texture the entire scene, as most of the models we used came without their own
            textures. The materials were assigned in our own renderer, since the material formats that are provided by the Wavefront OBJ standard did not give us enough control over the material properties. Finally, we added three point-lights, a directional
            light, and multiple area lights to set the mood of our scene, and added an environment map to simulate a night sky.

                    <b>Normal Mapping</b>
                    <p>To fake height differences in a surface one of the best ways is using normal mapping. By perturbing the normals at ray hit points a displaced surface can be simulated. The use of this can especially be seen on the walls of the buildings
                        (see the image on the right)</p>
